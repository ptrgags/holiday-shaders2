# Holiday Shaders 2 (2017)

This project is a collection of GLSL shader art I made as a holiday
present for friends back in 2017.

This was my second year of making shader art, after making
[`holiday-shaders`](https://github.com/ptrgags/holiday-shaders2).

More documentation can be found on the GitHub page for this
repo, https://holiday2.shaders.dev/
