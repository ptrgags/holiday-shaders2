                <p>
                    Thank you to the following people for giving me inspiration
                    for some of my shader designs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        My co-worker <b>Tom Thi</b> brought in googly eyes
                        for a joke. This was the inspiration for my Googly Eyes
                        design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My friend <b>Sarah DiChristino-Brennan</b>
                        (Instagram | Bandcamp) suggested a spiral pattern.
                        This was my inspiration for Spirals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My friend <b>Karishma Changlani</b>(DeviantArt | GitHub) made
                        <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/art/Tinted-Glass-453147711">
                            this fractal
                        </a>. It was the inspiraton for my shader Stained Glass.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="text-center">Feedback</h3>
                <p>
                    I was fortunate that many of my friends gave me good
                    feedback on my shaders so I was able to improve many of
                    them. Thank you to the following people for your feedback!
                </p>
                <ul>

                        A special thank you to my friend <b>Genna Hennessy</b>(Twitter | Tumblr) for
                        helping me reorganize the website layout. It looks
                        so much cleaner than when I started!

                        Thanks again to my friend <b>Karishma Changlani</b> (DeviantArt | GitHub) for
                        giving me feedback that helped me tweak several of my
                        shaders.

                        Thank you to DeviantArt user <b>PonceIndustries</b> (DeviantArt)
                        for your many comments on my preview screenshots! Our
                        discussions led me to find several variations on the
                        Newton and Mandelbrot Set fractals.

                    <li>
                        And thank you to all my other watchers on DeviantArt for
                        your support throughout the month!
